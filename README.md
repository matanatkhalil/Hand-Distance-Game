# Hand-Distance-Game
A computer-vision mini game built with OpenCV and MediaPipe hand tracking.
The player interacts with on-screen targets by using hand distance from the camera.

## About this project
This project was created as a learning exercise by following a tutorial and then adapting the code.
Several parts were modified and debugged to improve usability across different screen sizes.

## Based on
This project is based on the following YouTube tutorial:
[Hand Distance Measurement with Normal Webcam + Game | OpenCV Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGQgRH2_kq8)

## Features
- Real-time hand tracking
- Distance estimation using quadratic polynomial regression
- Screen-size–independent target placement
- Time-based scoring system

## Modifications
- Fixed target placement to adapt to camera resolution
- Ensured targets remain fully visible across different screen sizes 

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- cvzone
- MediaPipe

## Notes
This repository is for learning and experimentation purposes.
